# sample-projects (Data Science)
This repository contains projects exploring Data science, Machine Learning.

The folders contain following functionalities:

1.NN_numpy :  The neural network algorithm, by creating a model from scratch only with NumPy. Explains how forward/backpropagation and weight normalization/activation of the simple single-layer neural network work. Have used the famous MNIST dataset.

2.ML_numpy :  An exercise representing a complete machine learning process from preprocessing to model performance testing by using the functions developed using only NumPy without using any other libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, or scipy.

3. Clothing_Image_Classification : Creating a model using tensor flow for image detection.

4. ML_cycle_diabetes.ipynb : Created a complete machine learning cycle from data preparation to deployment. The dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.Libraries used are sklearn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, pickle.
