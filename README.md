# sample-projects (Data Science)
This repository contains projects exploring Data science, Machine Learning.

The folders contain following functionalities:

1. The neural network algorithm, by creating a model from scratch only with NumPy. Explains how forward/backpropagation and weight normalization/activation of the simple single-layer neural network work. Have used the famous MNIST dataset.

2. An exercise representing a complete machine learning process from preprocessing to model performance testing by using the functions developed using only NumPy without using any other libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, or scipy.

3. Creating a model using tensor flow for image detection.
